This C++ code implements a Caesar cipher, a basic encryption and decryption technique. The user can choose to either encrypt or decrypt a given text using a specified shift value. The program then displays the original and encrypted text (for encryption) or the Caesar cipher text and decrypted text (for decryption). The Caesar cipher involves shifting each alphabet letter by a fixed number of positions. The code uses a function, caesarCipher, to perform the encryption or decryption and handles user input to determine the operation and shift value.
